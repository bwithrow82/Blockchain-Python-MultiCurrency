Main Focus of a newly startup company is to build a portfolio management system (PMS) that supports both, traditional assets (gold, silver, stocks, etc.) and currently very hot topic - crypto-assets!! But as there are many coins, our task is to understand how HD wallets work, and to build a system that can create them.

Race to capture the market
hd-wallet-derive - A command line tool that supports BIP32, BIP39 and BIP44 and also supports non-standard derivation paths for the most popular wallets. Unfortunately, there arent many tools available in python and we need to integrate the script in backend with python.

Once the integration is done with this "universal" wallet, one can manage billions of addresses across 300+ coins, giving a serious edge against the competition.

Dependencies
PHP must be installed on operating system (any version, 5 or 7). No need to know any PHP

Clone the hd-wallet-derive tool.
